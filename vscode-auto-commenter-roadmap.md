# VSCode Python Auto-Commenter Extension Roadmap

## 1. Project Overview

### Description
A VSCode extension that automatically generates and suggests comments for Python code by tracking changes and utilizing LLMs (both local and API-based) to generate contextual comments.

### Key Features
- Real-time change tracking
- Automated comment generation
- Custom UI panel for managing suggestions
- Support for both local and API-based LLMs
- Interactive comment acceptance/rejection system

## 2. Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Change Tracking Service**
   - File change monitoring system
   - Diff generation between saves
   - Change metadata management

2. **LLM Integration Layer**
   - Support for local LLMs (e.g., llama.cpp)
   - API integration for cloud LLMs
   - Comment generation pipeline
   - Prompt engineering and optimization

3. **UI Components**
   - Custom VSCode webview panel
   - Comment suggestion interface
   - Accept/reject controls
   - Change history view

4. **Comment Management System**
   - Comment insertion logic
   - Code parsing and modification
   - Comment placement optimization
