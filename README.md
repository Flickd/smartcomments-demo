# smartcomments-demo README

This is the demo for the Automated Comment Generation.

## Features

There is a simplistic UI, that tracks the last changes in the user's file and after a few seconds shows an AI generated inline comment. With the accept button the comment is written into the file at the right place. For the AI we used https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct integrated over the Huggingface API.

## Testing Guide
Follow these steps if you want to test this extension out for yourselves:

1. Install VS Code or Cursor: https://code.visualstudio.com/download , https://www.cursor.com/
2. Install Git https://git-scm.com/downloads and Node.js https://nodejs.org/en
3. Clone the Repo or just download the .zip
4. Open the Project in VS Code
5. Open the Terminal by pressing **Ctrl + Ã–** and execute the command `npm install`. This will install all required packages for the extension.
6. You need to set your Huggingface API key/token by presing **Ctrl + Shift + P** and searching **Open User Settings**. There you search for **Hugging Face API** and you should see an input box where you can place your Key/token.
7. Press f5
This should open a new VS Code window for testing the extension.
8. You can use this new window normally. Open the extension UI by clicking the extension icon. Create a python file and type some code, than you should see the last changes and AI generated comments appear in the UI.

It is normal that the text overlaps in the UI, we just didnt bother to format it well. The important thing is that API, the UI, changes tracker and buttons work.
